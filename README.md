# Javapedia

* Javapedia is a client program allowing a user to browse, create, and interact with articles stored in a local directory. It is similar to Wikipedia, except that the articles are stored on a user's computer rather than the internet. Users can search the database of articles using key words, and the program will return the top 3 articles that best match the search phrase. Users can also search for articles by title, and can add or remove them from a database. Javapedia uses efficient data structures so that search time is quick. It returns matching articles using cosine similarity, an efficient method of comparing two texts.
* Javapedia can be ran with any Java IDE. The file that launches the user interface is Javapedia.java.
